# CSU4405-Computer-Graphics

The project title is Toward a Futuristic Emerald Isle. This project is
strictly individual (no groupwork). Your project will be demonstrated in your project
deliverables, but you may additionally be required to demonstrate your working program
to the lecturer upon request.
Your application should include the following features:
- The application is implemented in C/C++, using shader-based OpenGL 3.3.
- A minimum frame rate of 15 FPS must be achieved, when running on the latest generation
  of GPU (i.e., a desktop 4090).
  Refer to Lab 4 on how frame rate is calculated and displayed in the window title.
- The application should demonstrate an infinite scene. The camera should be controllable
  (using up, down, left, right keys or mouse buttons).
  When the camera moves, the application should simulate an endingless effect, demonstrating
  that the camera can move without going out of the scene.
- The application should include the four basic features covered in Lab 1, 2, 3, 4:
  geometry rendering, texture mapping, lighting and shadow, and animation.
- The application should allow user interaction and camera-control. User should be
  able to move around the scene using the keyboard and/or the mouse. At a minimum,
  implement moving forwards and backwards, turning left and turning right.
- The application should include an implementation of one of the following advanced
  features that are not discussed in the class. For other features you are welcome to
  discuss with the lecturer before implementing them.
